There is no need to build the OpenCV library if not only using CPU, the downloaded binaries are enough
include these libraries:
libtesseract302.lib
libtesseract302d.lib
liblept168.lib
liblept168d.lib
opencv_core246.lib
opencv_imgproc246.lib
opencv_highgui246.lib
opencv_ml246.lib
opencv_video246.lib
opencv_features2d246.lib
opencv_calib3d246.lib

For cuda support:
CMAKE to build OpenCV library with WITH_CUDA=true
OpenGL required to display MAT images with GPU
